<!--
  Use nciman.exe in the admin folder from the setup directory to create
  an unattended file. Keep in mind that if you install additional features
  besides the client, you also need to remove them seperately.

  It seems that one should always reboot after installation or upgrade,
  details on the return code of acu.exe are scarce.

  Also it seems that setupsp.inf might be used when upgrading to a newer
  service pack, of the same version, which might cause user interaction if
  not altered.

<!--
  INSTRUCTIONS
  1) Extract ACU to '%SOFTWARE%\Novell\Netware Client\NT%OS_MAJOR%\'.
  2) Create '%SOFTWARE%\Novell\Netware Client\NT%OS_MAJOR%\unattend.txt'.

  NOTES
  1) 2k/XP only for now
  2) Not sure what happens with upgrade and downgrade actions, but it happily
     installs on clean Windows installs (my primary target).
